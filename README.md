# Banking System

A simple Java console-based banking system application. This project allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and view balances. It is designed for beginners to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation and inheritance.

## Features

- Create accounts with a unique account number, holder name, and initial balance.
- Deposit money into the account.
- Withdraw money (with checks for sufficient balance).
- View account details and current balance.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation**: Attributes are private and accessed via public getters and setters.
- **Inheritance**: A `SavingsAccount` class inherits from the base `Account` class.
